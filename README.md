# DataVisualisationWithR

Hello Everyone! This is the Readme File for the **Data Visualisation with R** Workshop (delivered by the Centre in December 2020). 

This workshop is focusing on **visualising your data** . 

There is much more you can do with R and R Studio and there are a lot of video tutorials you can watch and posts you can read: 

- If you want to learn more on **Data Wrangling** with R: [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-wrangling-in-r/welcome?u=50251009 ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-wrangling-in-r/welcome?u=50251009)[https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html ](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
- If you want to keep learn **small bits over a long period** of time this is a very interesting approach[ https://www.linkedin.com/learning/r-for-data-science- lunchbreak-lessons/exercise-files?u=50251009 ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/r-for-data-science-lunchbreak-lessons/exercise-files?u=50251009)
- **Machine Learning** with R[ https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine- learning-in-r-step-by-step/ ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-r-step-by-step/)[https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-in-r ](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-in-r)
- If you want to learn more on using **R and GIS together**

More generally, the good thing of R being an Open Source software means you can find  a lot of help online. If at any point of your research you get stuck on something just google the issue and 99% of times someone else posted about it already! 

The best sites on where to **find info and help** are: 

- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ](https://stackoverflow.com/)
